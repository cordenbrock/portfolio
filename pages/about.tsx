            told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you
            something to cry about you little bastard! They're using our own

            Yes, Yes, without the oops! Hey, you know how I'm, like, always
            trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. This thing comes fully
            loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.
